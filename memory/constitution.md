# Agentic Coding Constitution

## Core Principles

### Article I. Component-First Development
Every feature begins as a self-contained, modular component. Components must be independently testable with clear interfaces and documented contracts. No component should exist solely for organizational purposes - each must provide demonstrable value. Dependencies between components must be explicit and minimized.

### Article II. Interface Standardization
All components expose functionality through standardized interfaces. Primary interaction follows text-based protocols: structured input → processing → structured output. Errors propagate through designated channels. Support both machine-readable and human-readable formats. Maintain backward compatibility through versioned interfaces.

### Article III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all new functionality. The cycle is strictly enforced: Write tests → Review test design → Tests must fail → Implement solution → Tests pass → Refactor. No code merges without corresponding tests. Tests document expected behavior and serve as living documentation.

### Article IV. Integration Verification
Critical integration points require comprehensive testing:
- Component contract boundaries
- Inter-service communication protocols
- Shared data schemas and transformations
- External dependency interactions
- State synchronization mechanisms
All integration tests must use real or high-fidelity mock dependencies.

### Article V. Observability & Transparency
All components must be observable and debuggable. Structured logging is required at component boundaries. Performance metrics tracked at critical paths. Error tracking with correlation identifiers across components. Audit trails for state changes. No black boxes - internal state must be inspectable.

### Article VI. Versioning & Evolution
Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) strictly enforced. Breaking changes require:
- Documented migration path
- Deprecation warnings in prior version
- Parallel support period defined
- Automated migration tools where feasible
All APIs versioned independently from implementation.

### Article VII. Simplicity & Maintainability
Start simple, iterate based on proven need. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles apply. Complexity must be justified by measurable requirements. Prefer composition over inheritance. Limit abstraction layers to three levels. No premature optimization without profiling data.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Metrics
- Maximum file length: 300 lines
- Maximum function length: 50 lines
- Maximum function parameters: 5
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity: 10
- Maximum nesting depth: 3 levels
- Minimum test coverage: 80% for new code

### Documentation Requirements
- Every public interface must be documented
- Complex algorithms require inline explanation
- Architecture decisions recorded in decision records
- API changes tracked in changelog
- Examples provided for all public interfaces

### Security Constraints
- No secrets in code, configuration, or logs
- Input validation at all boundaries
- Output encoding for all external data
- Principle of least privilege for all access
- Security review required for authentication/authorization changes
- Cryptographic operations use approved libraries only

## Review Process

### Code Review Gates
1. Automated tests pass
2. Code coverage meets minimum standards
3. No security vulnerabilities detected
4. Documentation complete and accurate
5. Performance benchmarks within acceptable range
6. Breaking changes properly versioned

### Review Priorities
1. Correctness and safety
2. Maintainability and clarity
3. Performance optimization
4. Feature completeness
5. Code style consistency

## Operational Excellence

### Deployment Requirements
- Zero-downtime deployments supported
- Rollback capability within 5 minutes
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Canary deployments for critical changes
- Health checks at all service boundaries

### Monitoring Standards
- Alert on user-impacting issues only
- SLO/SLI defined for critical paths
- Error budgets tracked and enforced
- Runbooks for all alerts
- Post-incident reviews without blame

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Any deviation requires:
1. Written justification of necessity
2. Documented exception with expiration date
3. Review by technical leadership
4. Update to relevant documentation

### Amendment Process
Constitutional amendments require:
1. Proposal with rationale and impact analysis
2. Review period of at least 5 business days
3. Consensus from technical stakeholders
4. Migration plan for existing code
5. Update to all dependent documentation

### Compliance Verification
- All code reviews verify constitutional compliance
- Automated checks enforce measurable standards
- Quarterly audits of constitutional adherence
- Exceptions tracked and reviewed monthly
- Continuous improvement based on metrics
